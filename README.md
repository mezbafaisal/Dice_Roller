Creating a Dice Roller project in Python, a program that emulates rolling a standard six-sided die. Users can roll the die and receive a random number between 1 and 6, just like rolling a physical die.

Here's a step-by-step description of how to create a dice roller in Python:

1. User Interface:
You can create a simple text-based interface to interact with the user. For example, you might display a menu like this:


Welcome to the Dice Roller!
1. Roll the die
   
2. Random Number Generation:
Use Python's random module to generate a random number between 1 and 6. You can do this with random.randint(1, 6).

3. User Input Handling:
Allow the user to choose options from the menu. If they choose to roll the die, generate a random number and display it to the user.

4. Looping:
You can implement a loop to keep the program running until the user decides to quit. This can be done with a while loop.

5. Error Handling:
Handle invalid inputs gracefully. If the user enters an option that's not in the menu, provide feedback.

Here's a simple code snippet to get you started:

while True:
    print("Welcome to the Dice Roller!")
    print("1. Roll the die")
    print("2. Quit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

    if choice == '1':
        # Roll the die and display the result
        result = random.randint(1, 6)
        print(f"You rolled a {result}")
    elif choice == '2':
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please select 1 or 2.")
